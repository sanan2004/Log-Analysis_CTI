## Overall Log Anomaly Analysis

Based on the log summary, I've identified some potential security concerns that warrant further investigation.

The high error rate of 0.40% is relatively low, but it's still worth noting. The presence of only two unique IP addresses suggests a limited number of users accessing the website, which could be a red flag if these users are exhibiting suspicious behavior.

The most concerning aspect is the presence of two high-risk IPs with scores above 50. This indicates that these IPs have been flagged for potential malicious activity.

Here's a breakdown of each high-risk IP:

1. 18.237.3.202:
	* Score: 100
	* Number of requests: 6366
	* Number of errors: 19

This IP has an extremely high score, indicating a significant amount of suspicious activity. The large number of requests and errors suggests that this IP may be attempting to brute-force or scan the website for vulnerabilities.

2. 14.103.172.199:
	* Score: 90
	* Number of requests: 412
	* Number of errors: 8

This IP has a high score, indicating potential malicious activity. The relatively lower number of requests and errors compared to the first IP

## Recommendations

1. **Block High-Risk IPs:** Consider blocking the identified high-risk IP addresses at the firewall level.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase monitoring for the suspicious IP addresses and similar patterns.
3. **Security Review:** Conduct a thorough security review of applications targeted by these requests.
4. **Incident Response:** If evidence of compromise is found, initiate incident response procedures.
5. **Threat Hunting:** Use these IOCs to hunt for additional related threats in your environment.
