## Overall Log Anomaly Analysis

Based on the log summary, I've identified some potential security concerns that warrant further investigation.

The error rate of 0.40% is relatively low, indicating that the web server is functioning normally. However, the presence of high-risk IPs with scores above 50 suggests a possible coordinated attack or malicious activity.

The two high-risk IP addresses, 18.237.3.202 and 14.103.172.199, are making a significant number of requests (6366 and 412, respectively) and experiencing errors (19 and 8, respectively). This could indicate a brute-force attack or a scanning activity aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities.

The fact that these high-risk IPs only account for two unique IP addresses out of the total 2, suggests that they may be part of a coordinated effort. The low number of unique IP addresses also raises suspicions, as it's unusual to have such a small number of distinct IP addresses making requests to your web server.

To further investigate this potential security threat, I recommend:

1. Reviewing the request logs in more detail to identify specific URLs or parameters being targeted.
2. Analyzing the error messages and 4xx errors to determine if they are related to authentication attempts, SQL injection, or

## Recommendations

1. **Block High-Risk IPs:** Consider blocking the identified high-risk IP addresses at the firewall level.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase monitoring for the suspicious IP addresses and similar patterns.
3. **Security Review:** Conduct a thorough security review of applications targeted by these requests.
4. **Incident Response:** If evidence of compromise is found, initiate incident response procedures.
5. **Threat Hunting:** Use these IOCs to hunt for additional related threats in your environment.
