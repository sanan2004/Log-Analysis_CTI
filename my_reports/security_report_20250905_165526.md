## Overall Log Anomaly Analysis

Based on the log summary, I've identified some potential security concerns that warrant further investigation.

The first red flag is the unusually high number of requests from two IP addresses (18.237.3.202 and 14.103.172.199) with scores above 50, indicating a high-risk activity. This could be indicative of automated scanning or probing for vulnerabilities.

The fact that these high-risk IPs account for a significant portion of the total requests (6366 out of 6778) suggests a coordinated attack or scan. The error rates associated with these IP addresses are also concerning, with 18.237.3.202 experiencing 19 errors and 14.103.172.199 experiencing 8 errors.

The low number of unique IP addresses (only 2) is another indication that the traffic may be artificially generated by a single entity or botnet.

Given these findings, I recommend further analysis to determine the nature of the attacks and potential vulnerabilities exploited. This could involve:

1. Reviewing the request logs in more detail to identify specific attack patterns and potentially malicious requests.
2. Conducting a vulnerability scan to identify any open ports or services that may be exploitable.
3. Analyzing system logs for any suspicious login

## Recommendations

1. **Block High-Risk IPs:** Consider blocking the identified high-risk IP addresses at the firewall level.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase monitoring for the suspicious IP addresses and similar patterns.
3. **Security Review:** Conduct a thorough security review of applications targeted by these requests.
4. **Incident Response:** If evidence of compromise is found, initiate incident response procedures.
5. **Threat Hunting:** Use these IOCs to hunt for additional related threats in your environment.
