## Overall Log Anomaly Analysis

Based on the log summary, I've identified some potential security threats and anomalies that warrant further investigation:

1. **High error rate**: The error rate is relatively high at 0.40%, which may indicate a potential attack or malfunctioning client-side code.
2. **Limited unique IP addresses**: With only two unique IP addresses, it's possible that these are compromised devices or part of a coordinated attack.
3. **High-risk IPs**: Both high-risk IPs have scores above 50, indicating a higher likelihood of malicious activity.

The specific concerns regarding the high-risk IPs are:

* **18.237.3.202**: This IP has a score of 100 and made 6366 requests with 19 errors. This could be indicative of a bot or scraper attempting to overwhelm the server.
* **14.103.172.199**: This IP has a score of 90 and made 412 requests with 8 errors. While not as aggressive as the first IP, this could still be a compromised device or part of a coordinated attack.

Recommendations:

1. **Block suspicious IPs**: Block both high-risk IPs to prevent further malicious activity.
2. **Monitor for similar patterns**: Continuously monitor logs for similar patterns and anomalies

## Recommendations

1. **Block High-Risk IPs:** Consider blocking the identified high-risk IP addresses at the firewall level.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase monitoring for the suspicious IP addresses and similar patterns.
3. **Security Review:** Conduct a thorough security review of applications targeted by these requests.
4. **Incident Response:** If evidence of compromise is found, initiate incident response procedures.
5. **Threat Hunting:** Use these IOCs to hunt for additional related threats in your environment.
