## Overall Log Anomaly Analysis

Based on the log summary, I've identified some potential security concerns that warrant further investigation.

**Anomalous Patterns:**

1. **High-Risk IPs:** Two IP addresses (18.237.3.202 and 14.103.172.199) have high-risk scores (>50), indicating a higher likelihood of malicious activity.
2. **Concentrated Requests:** The first high-risk IP address (18.237.3.202) has made an unusually large number of requests (6366) compared to the total number of requests (6778). This could be indicative of a bot or scraper attempting to overwhelm the server.
3. **Error Rate:** Although the overall error rate is relatively low (0.40%), the high-risk IPs have significantly higher error rates (19/6366 and 8/412, respectively). This might suggest that these IP addresses are experiencing issues with the server or intentionally trying to evade detection.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Block High-Risk IPs:** Implement IP blocking or rate limiting for the two high-risk IP addresses to prevent further malicious activity.
2. **Monitor Request Patterns:** Closely monitor request patterns from these IP addresses and other suspicious sources to identify potential attack vectors

## Recommendations

1. **Block High-Risk IPs**: Consider blocking the identified high-risk IP addresses at the firewall level.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase monitoring for the suspicious IP addresses and similar patterns.
3. **Security Review**: Conduct a thorough security review of applications targeted by these requests.
4. **Incident Response**: If evidence of compromise is found, initiate incident response procedures.
5. **Threat Hunting**: Use these IOCs to hunt for additional related threats in your environment.
6. **Cisco Talos Integration**: Consider integrating Cisco Talos threat intelligence into your security infrastructure.
