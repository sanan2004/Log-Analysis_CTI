## Overall Log Anomaly Analysis

Based on the log summary, I've identified some potential security concerns that warrant further investigation.

The high error rate (0.40%) is relatively low, but the presence of two high-risk IP addresses with scores above 50 suggests a coordinated attack or malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious activity:

1. **IP Address 18.237.3.202**:
	* Score: 100
	* Requests: 6366
	* Errors: 19

This IP address is making an unusually high number of requests (6366) and experiencing a moderate number of errors (19). The score of 100 indicates that this IP has been flagged as high-risk, suggesting potential malicious activity.

2. **IP Address 14.103.172.199**:
	* Score: 100
	* Requests: 412
	* Errors: 8

This IP address is also flagged as high-risk with a score of 100 and has made fewer requests (412) but still experienced some errors (8). This could indicate a targeted attack or reconnaissance activity.

The fact that both IP addresses have scores above 50 suggests a coordinated effort, possibly an automated botnet or a targeted attack. The low

## Recommendations

1. **Block High-Risk IPs:** Consider blocking the identified high-risk IP addresses at the firewall level.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase monitoring for the suspicious IP addresses and similar patterns.
3. **Security Review:** Conduct a thorough security review of applications targeted by these requests.
4. **Incident Response:** If evidence of compromise is found, initiate incident response procedures.
5. **Threat Hunting:** Use these IOCs to hunt for additional related threats in your environment.
